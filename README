# AFTER CLONE
cp git-hooks/pre-push .git/hooks/pre-push

# BEFORE PUSHING LIVE
./manage.py dumpdata -o comic_data_dump.json --format=json --indent=4

# now covered by pre-push hook
echo "yes" | ./manage.py collectstatic

# AFTER A PULL
pip install -r requirements.txt # add this to post-receive?
./manage.py migrate

have a look at hooks/post-receive for what happens on production automatically after each deploy
for sudo use sudo visudo on production to not require password for that command


## PRODUCTION DEPLOY NOTES
www-data:www-data must own directory and db.sqlite3 so that sessions can be written to database
...but lus must be owner for git post-receive to work
...so db.sqlite3 is writable by any user on server
